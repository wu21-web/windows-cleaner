        <p>
            This is an instruction of cleaner.py, a program which cleans unnecessary files. It checks the platform of OS (operating system) that its on.
            To prevent from deleting important files, we only designed a cleaner of the temp folder, which is not important to the operating system.
            After cleaning, the files in the temp folder will be trashed, and can't be refound. Then it will return the number of bytes being trashed.
